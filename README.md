This is my first repo as an implementation of HTMl, CSS and javaScript.  
In the javascript a number of functions are coded as per activities 
The handleQuestions function shuffles and selects 20 questions from an array.
The NextQuestion function displays the current question, its options, and updates the question number and player score.
The checkForAnswer function checks if a radio input has been selected and compares it to the correct answer.
